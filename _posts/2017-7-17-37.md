This dessert breakfast served with superb sausage marks the
end of my breakfasts at the 42 Silicon Valley Cantina.
Don't worry! It's only for the next month and a half.
In the mean time get ready for cerealize.me vacation edition!
I toasted to my temporary goodbye with a bowl of cereal of course!

Today I'm thinking about **TOPIC**:

Content on TOPIC goes here.
I'm currently catching up on old posts.
I'm on vacation too, not that it's the best excuse...
I'm thinking about what needs to be done over here!
But I'll come back and write more, promise!

I'll have more content for you later awesome readers!

The TODO list:
* Things you should do today.

The Ice Box:
* Publicly known things I should be doing
* I don't have motivation for

an until later, when I finish this post!
