#Learning PHP

For last week, and all this week- I'm learning PHP.
The PHP piscine here is the first taste web, OOP, and databases in the 42 cursus.

Check out the minishop that another student and myself created last weekend for the rush: [ft_minishop](https://github.com/qst0/ft_minishop)

Curious about 42? I hope to write more about my time here, but the most important thing to know is that at 42, all your time is for coding!

Stay tuned.
