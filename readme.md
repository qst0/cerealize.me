**Cerealize is still on pause, although I am back from vacation.**
**I need another few weeks to focus on my applications and interviews.**

What if I wrote a blog post every morning for breakfast?

It would have to be super easy, and follow a formula.

1. What is the first meal of my day?

2. What am I thinking about?

3. Picture please.

And so, [I was cerealized](http://cerealize.me).
